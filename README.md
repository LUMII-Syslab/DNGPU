# DNGPU
Code for reproducing key results in the paper "Improving the Neural GPU Architecture for Algorithm Learning" by Karlis Freivalds, Renars Liepins.

The code demonstrates several improvements to the Neural GPU that substantially reduces training time and improves generalization. The improvements are: 1) hard nonlinearities with saturation cost; 2) diagonal gates that can be applied to active-memory models.

### Porformance comparison with NGPU
The proposed improvements achieve substantial gains:
* the model can learn binary multiplication in 800 steps versus 30000 steps that are needed for the original Neural-GPU;
* all the trained models generalize to 100 times longer inputs with less than 1% error versus the original Neural-GPU where only some generalize to less then 10 times longer inputs.
